Main Points;
To begin, I had to download Git and GitBASH in order to be able to apply proper version control.
After making an account at GitHub (as the GitLab accounts were not ready) I generated an ssh key using the command:

and my associated email.
The key was then added to my account in Github
With this I will be able to pull, commit, and clone straight from my GitBASH terminal without having to go through the website.

Since I had never studied using HTML for web design before this I opted to use the Markdown language and MKDocs as it allowed me to produce readable webpages using very basic syntax.
The template provided to us by Engineer Hashem helped me make a start, I used the website below to get a quick grasp on Markdown syntax.
I already had python and pip installed and up-to-date on my PC, so there was no need to do anything o set that up
I used pip to install MKDocs
then installed the specific theme for my website: material
I used ATOM in order to edit the template and write the Markdown code, it is a simple text editor compatible with the language which I found to be helpful.
